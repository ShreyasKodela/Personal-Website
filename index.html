                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Shreyas! I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Florida, pursuing a Bachelor's degree with a Certificate in Artificial Intelligence. I'm passionate about software engineering, data analytics, and AI/ML technologies, and I'm excited to leverage my experience in a 2025 internship in Software Engineering or Data Analytics to deliver innovative and impactful solutions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As a Software Engineer Intern at HNTB, I developed backend APIs and microservices using C#/.NET, improving application performance by 25%. I also streamlined CI/CD processes with Azure DevOps, reducing deployment time by 42%. I have led Agile sprints and collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality features.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At ZE PowerGroup, I worked as a Database Analyst Intern, optimizing database schemas to boost query efficiency by 30% and ensuring timely delivery of database solutions using SDLC principles.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My projects reflect my passion for solving real-world challenges. I built a traffic signal controller health monitoring system for the Florida Department of Transportation using Angular and Azure SQL, aggregating real-time data from over 9,800 traffic controllers. I also developed SportsBet AI, an AI-powered sports prediction app that improved athlete performance prediction accuracy by 14% across the NFL, NBA, and MLB.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I co-founded HelpingSoup.com, a non-profit platform connecting shelters with community members, helping over 1,250 individuals in the Tallahassee area. Currently, I serve as the Internal Vice President & Treasurer of the Association of Computing Machinery at UF, coordinating events for 2,000+ members and developing tools to streamline job postings.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm excited to apply my skills in software development, data analysis, and machine learning to projects that create impact. I thrive in dynamic, team-driven environments where I can grow, innovate, and contribute to meaningful work.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Outside of tech, I love basketball, football, fantasy sports, escape rooms, and exploring new cuisines. I'm always looking for creative ways to solve challenges and bring fresh ideas to the table.</p>
                <br>
